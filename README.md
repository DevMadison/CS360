Mobile Application Development

The app I developed is an Inventory Based mobile application designed for storing items in a list with CRUD functionality. The user will be able to add, delete, read, and update the count of items within the inventory. Primarily used by business owners, the app also has the ability to request for SMS permission so that the user can receive notifications regarding the count of inventory items: if the count is low or reduced to zero. 

Multiple screens for necessary to decrease the complexity of the user interface. Too many items on a screen can overwhelm a user, and makes it harder for them to find what they are looking for. I divided the screens up by addition, deletion, sms permissions, inventory list, and updating count. I made the buttons large and at the top of the page so it is the first thing they see. The text is also large and in a font that is easy to read. The background is kept at white so that the buttons and text stick out more. 

When coding my app, I divided each activity that the application needed into sections/classes. I did not want to put too much code within one file, so although it looks like there are wayy too many files, it actually makes reading the code within them easier. All my variables are straight to the point regarding what they are for/their action in the application, and this goes the same with my objects. 

Testing my code was the hardest part about the entire application. Android Studio is extremely sesnitive and seems like it is always trying to pick fights with me. Before I even hit build on my code, I went through every single file and fixed anything underlined in red, and then some things underlined in yellow, but the yellow-underlying got to be extremely tedious since it would be upset at me using a string twice. 

I would say that I am the best with the xml files when it comes to my skills. I enjoy designing the interface this way and the code is not too hard for me to understand, learn, and fix. Java in itself is a beast to tame, and I had the most difficulty with my java classes and getting them to be error-free. 

Thank you!
